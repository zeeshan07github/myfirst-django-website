        Django is a high-level web framework written in Python that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural
        pattern. It aims to simplify and accelerate web development by providing a set of tools and conventions.
    
        Here are some key features and concepts of Django:
    
        Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): Django includes a powerful ORM that allows developers to interact with the database
        using Python objects. It abstracts away the complexities of SQL queries and provides a convenient way to define
        database models and perform database operations.
    
        URL Routing and View Functions: Django uses a URL routing system to map URLs to view functions. URLs are defined in
        a centralized urls.py file, and each URL pattern is associated with a corresponding view function or class-based
        view. Views handle HTTP requests, process the logic, and return an HTTP response.
    
        Template Engine: Django has its own template engine, which allows you to create dynamic HTML templates by combining
        HTML with template tags and filters. Templates support variables, loops, conditionals, and other control structures,
        making it easier to generate dynamic content.
    
        Forms and Form Validation: Django provides a form handling system that simplifies the process of handling user input
        and form validation. It includes built-in form fields, form validation, and error handling mechanisms.
    
        Authentication and Authorization: Django offers a robust authentication system that handles user registration,
        login, logout, and password management. It also provides authorization mechanisms to control access to different
        parts of the application based on user roles and permissions.
    
         secure web development.
    
        Scalability and Reusability: Django is designed with scalability in mind, allowing developers to build complex and
        scalable web applications. It promotes modular and reusable code by encouraging the use of apps, which are
        self-contained modules that encapsulate specific functionalities.
